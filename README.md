This is meant as a supplementary set of schema design exercises (like what James and I have done on the whiteboards) to help firm up conceptualizing tables.  Feel free to take as much or little of this in as is helpful, especially as it might introduce some new topics about git, GitHub, and Markdown formatting.  

The schema-explanations directory contains examples of four different schema designs.  A lone table, a one-to-one, a one-to-many, and a many-to-many.  You don't have to clone this repo if you just want to look at the schema-explorations directory, but feel free.  You will need to clone it if you want to do any of the exercises and have me look at them.  If the pull request instructions are needlessly confusing just follow steps 1-4 and shoot me a message on slack or something.

## Completing the exercises
Read this entire README first, but the my_solution.md file contains instructions for completing each step of the exercise.

## Schema Designer
Check out [this](http://ondras.zarovi.cz/sql/demo/) schema designer.  If it's being a bit buggy for you like it is right now for me, take advantage of the empty ascii schemas in the my solution file.  

Here's a screenshare showing how to use it.  For the sake of our purposes don't worry about the specific datatypes.  Just use any integer (yellow) for integers and any text (red) for strings.

Don't push to master.  DON'T PUSH TO MASTER.  **Don't push to master.**
Is it reversible?  Pretend it's not.  On a larger project you're working on it would be a pain to undo so get good git habits now.

5.  Click the pull request button to start the pull request process.  Click through until you get to a branch select screen.
