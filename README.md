This is meant as a supplementary set of schema design exercises (like what James and I have done on the whiteboards) to help firm up conceptualizing tables.  Feel free to take as much or little of this in as is helpful.  

The schema-explanations directory contains examples of four different schema designs.  A lone table, a one-to-one, a one-to-many, and a many-to-many.
