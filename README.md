This is meant as a supplementary set of schema design exercises (like what James and I have done on the whiteboards) to help firm up conceptualizing tables.  Feel free to take as much or little of this in as is helpful.  

The schema-explanations directory contains examples of four different schema designs.  A lone table, a one-to-one, a one-to-many, and a many-to-many.  You don't have to clone this repo if you just want to look at the schema-explorations directory, but feel free.  You will need to clone it if you want to do any of the exercises and have me look at them.

Don't push to master.  DON'T PUSH TO MASTER.  **Don't push to master.**
Is it reversible?  Pretend it's not.  On a larger project you're working on it would be a pain to undo so get good git habits now.
